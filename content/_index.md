#        My research focuses on advancing our understanding of air-sea interactions and exploring how the ocean influences both regional weather and climate. 
#        
#        To address these complex issues, I utilize coupled Earth system models, such as the SCOAR Regional Coupled Mode, which simulate interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and surface waves. In addition to numerical simulations, I extensively analyze observational datasets of the marine boundary layer to evaluate current modeling capabilities and identify areas for improvement.
#        
#        Improving the representation of air-sea interactions in these models is crucial, not only for enhancing weather forecasts but also for optimizing offshore wind energy assessments.
