        [Seo Lab](https://www.hyodaeseo.com/) in the Department of Oceanography at the University of Hawai‚Äòi at MƒÅnoa invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher to join the ONR-funded [SAFARI](https://www.onr.navy.mil/organization/departments/code-32/division-322/marine-meteorology-space/sea-air-flux) project (Study of Air‚ÄìSea Fluxes and Atmospheric River Intensity). The project will utilize a combination of in situ and satellite observations, along with high-resolution coupled model simulations, to investigate the link between spatial variability of SST‚Äìwind‚Äìwave‚Äìcurrent interactions and the diabatic intensification or dissipation of atmospheric rivers through air-sea heat and momentum fluxes.  
        
        The successful candidate is expected to bring expertise in surface waves and air‚Äìsea interaction modeling, satellite remote sensing (e.g., SWOT), or analysis of in situ observations of air‚Äìsea fluxes, turbulent boundary layer processes, and/or their parameterizations. 
        
        Applicants must apply [online](https://hr.rcuh.com/psc/hcmprd_exapp/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&FOCUS=Applicant&SiteId=3&JobOpeningId=225530&PostingSeq=1). 
        
        Please contact Dr. Hyodae Seo (hyodae@hawaii.edu) and Dr. Cesar Sauvage (csauvage@hawaii.edu) with any questions.
