abstract: <div style="text-align:justify"> Large-scale offshore wind farms are expected to influence surface waves by modifying local wind forcing through wake effects. We use regional coupled ocean-atmosphere-wave model simulations to investigate a realistic large-scale offshore wind development scenario in the northeastern U.S. during boreal summer. Near-surface wind speeds are reduced by 10% over lease areas and within downstream wake regions, leading to decreases in significant wave height (3%) and wave-supported momentum flux (30%). This further leads to reductions in surface roughness length (16%) and near-surface ocean turbulent kinetic energy (20%). Spectral analysis shows a clear reduction in wind-sea energy, indicating suppressed local wind-wave growth near the wind farms. Weaker winds favor the development of longer-period waves, increasing dominant wave phase speed by 3% and suggesting a transition to an older sea state. Modern bulk flux algorithms often parameterize surface roughness using inverse wave age and/or wave slope. This raises the question of whether wake-driven reductions in inverse wave age and wave height impact air-sea momentum exchange. To assess this, we compare fully coupled simulations with an atmosphere-only run excluding wave coupling. Results show that about one-third of the reduction in roughness length can be attributed to sea state changes, while two-thirds result from lower friction velocity due to lower wind speeds. However, the impact of sea state on the drag coefficient and momentum flux is negligible (1%), suggesting that wake-induced wind speed reductions are the primary driver, with sea state changes playing a secondary role. </div>
